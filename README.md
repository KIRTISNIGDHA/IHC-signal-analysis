# IHC-signal-analysis
Analysis of immunohistochemistry signal intensity of confocal images 
__Background:__
Tumor cells are surrounded by normal cells like immune cells,blood vessels, cytokines, growth regulators etc. which constitute the tumor microenvironment(TME). It is proposed that tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in tumor development. We want to evaluate how the inflammatory pathways present in the TME affect tumor development. The TME was modeled by genetically inducing formation of tumor clones surrounded by normal cells in the drosophila wing imaginal discs. To evaulate inflammation components, immunohisochemistry was done followedby confocal imaging. Using measurement log function of Photoshop, signal intensity was measured in the tumor clones and the normal cells. 


__Analysis:__ The mean of signal intensity of the tumor and normal cell from 5 different sample is obtained and compared to analyse any significant change in inflammatory component during tumor development. 

__The goal of this project is to write a code which will do following steps:__
1. Read the excel file 
2. Create a dataframe that contains the document and integrated density data
3. Check for duplication of data
4. Sort the data for normal and tumor samples
5. Calculate the mean signal intesity for each sample in both categories 
6. Visualize the signal intensities using bar graph
7. Perform descriptive statistics 
8. Perform inferential statistics
9. Result
